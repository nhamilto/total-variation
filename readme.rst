Total Variation
----------------------------

Tools and demonstration for the total variation method supporting Hamilton, Nicholas. Total variation of atmospheric data: covariance minimization about objective functions to detect conditions of interest. No. NREL/JA-5000-73703. National Renewable Energy Lab.(NREL), Golden, CO (United States), 2019.

Background and Objectives
=========================

THe methods suggested herein are applied to met mast data  derived from a meteorological mast located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratoryâ€™s Flatirons campus. Additional data from the met mast is available at https://nwtc.nrel.gov/MetData (NREL, 2020) and the atmospheric conditions at NREL are summarized in Hamilton and Debnath (2019).
